Ripper6 is a program that extracts files from within other files.  The most
common use is searching the data files from games and demos, so that various
assets like music or sound effects can be extracted and saved into separate
files.

The following file formats are recognised and extracted:

 [Music]
  * .670: Renaissance CDFM/670
  * .bsa: The Bone Shaker Architect (TBSA0.01)
  * .cmf: Creative Music Files
  * .dsm: RIFF DSIK module
  * .ibk: OPL2 instrument bank
  * .mid: Standard MIDI
  * .rmi: RIFF MIDI
  * .s3m: ScreamTracker 3 module
  * .xmi: Miles eXtended MIDI

 [Audio]
  * .aiff: Audio Interchange File Format
  * .voc: Creative Voice Files
  * .wav: RIFF Wave

 [Image]
  * .lbm: InterLeaved BitMap

 [Misc]
  * Any standard RIFF file
  * Any standard IFF-FORM file

The program is compiled and installed in the usual way:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install

If you downloaded the git release, run ./autogen.sh before the commands above.
You can also run "make check" to compile and run the tests.

Most of the file formats are fully documented on the ModdingWiki - see

The name is based on the excellent Ripper 5 utility, released for the MS-DOS
platform in 1995 by JÎ˜Nas.

This library is released under the GPLv3 license.

Tip: Many DOS demos use custom compression, but running them through DOSBox and
then doing a binary memory dump will give you the decompressed data that can be
run through Ripper6.
